== BUILDING ==

Use the Makefile to properly build the stp_test executable:

	make -f Makefile.checker

== RUNNING ==

In order to run the test suite you can either use the run_tests.bash
script or run the stp_test executable.

The run_test.bash script runs all tests and computes assigment grade:

	./run_tests.bash

In order to run a specific test use the pass the test number (1 .. 33) to the
stp_test executable.

	./stp_test 12

== TESTS ==

Tests are basically unit tests. A single function in the test_fun_array (see
stp_test.c) is called each time the stp_test executable is invoked,
testing a single functionality (and assuming previous tests have been run and
passed).

The EXIT_IF_FAIL macro (see test.h) is unnecessary since after each test, the
program completes.

Each test function follows the unit test pattern: initialization, action,
evaluation. The test macro (see test.h) is invoked at the end of each test
for evaluating and grading the test.

== DEBUGGING ==

The debug.h header file consists of several macros useful for debugging
(dprintf, dlog). There are multiple uses of these macros throughout the above
files.

In order to turn debug messages on, you must define the DEBUG macro, either in
a header file, or, I suggest, in the Makefile. The LOG_LEVEL macro limits the
log message types that are to be printed, by default LOG_WARNING (see enum in
debug.h). You may redefine it in a header file or in the Makefile.

Rapid enabling of debug messages is achieved by commenting out the CPPFLAGS
line in the Makefile. It turns on debugging and enables all log messages
(LOG_DEBUG).

== OTHER ==

srand48() and drand48() are used for generating random numbers.
